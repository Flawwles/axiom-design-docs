          Attribute lozenges highlight an item's attributes.


          Color is used in a meaningful way to aid quick regonition across related themes such as:


          â€¢ Content sources â€“ using the \[social network colors] and \[page type colors] sets\

          â€¢ Interests, professions and locations â€“ using the \[curated product colors] set\

          â€¢ Sentiment using the \[sentiment colors] set

      - text: When there isn't any unifying themes (e.g user defined tags or categories)
          use the default style attribute lozenges.

          â€¢ Success: Completed successfully (e.g success, done, available, approved, added)\

          â€¢ Info: In progress or open (e.g in progress, open)\

          â€¢ Warning: requires attention (e.g busy, pending, blocked)\

          â€¢ Error: encounted a problem (e.g. error, declined, failed, critical).

      - title: Lozenges vs badges
        text: Do not use lozenges to show counts or numerical figures. Use badges
          instead.

      - title: Colors
        text: Use color in a meaningful way to aid quick regonition of an particular
          attribute or status.
        image: /assets/lozenges-best-practice-2.png
      - title: Overflow
        text: The maximum width for a lozenge is 160px. When the lozenge text exceeds
          the max width, the text will be truncated with ellipsis.
      - title: Label case
        image: /assets/lozenges-best-practice-4.png
        text: |-
          Attribute lozenges use sentance case.

          Status and spinner lozenges use uppercase.

          Do not mix the two different approaches.
