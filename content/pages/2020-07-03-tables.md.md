    blocks:
      - title: Right align numeric values
        text: When working with numeric values generally they should be right-aligned to
          provide ease of scanning and comparing. Column headers follow the
          alignment of the data. Numbers that do not need comparing, such as
          phone numbers, can be left aligned.
